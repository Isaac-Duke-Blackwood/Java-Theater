Hi! Welcome to my first ever java project. I used eclipse to design a program that uses .txt files to represent seats in a theater and lets the user reserve them as if it was to be used as 
an electronic kiosk at a theater. Feel free to check it out!

Note: the theaters can have any number of rows, but only 26 seats per row, because otherwise I run out of letters for the seats and stuff begins to look funky. The general format is shown 
below where the numbers represent rows and the letters represent seats within the row. A '.' denotes an open seat, whereas 'A' 'C' and 'S' denote adult child and senior tickets sold.
